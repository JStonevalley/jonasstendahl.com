        <p>I am a positive and outgoing person who likes challenges. I started studying to become a Computer Scientist in 2011 at The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden (KTH). Since then I have started my Master in Computer Science September 2014. I am interested in all activities that gets the adrenaline pumping such as skiing, sailing and generally racing of any kind. In combination with adrenaline activities I like to bring the camera since photography is also a hobby of mine. I have spent most my summers at a sailing camp where I have gone from pupil to instructor to leader of the camp. The summer of 2014 was the start of a new chapter in my life without the sailing camp and instead with Software Development at Giesecke & Devrient.</p>
